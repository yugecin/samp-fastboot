samp-fastboot
=============

some hacks to make gtasa and samp load faster

changes my time-to-connect duration from 14s to 3s

should work for any samp version

extra: makes F3 set your samp state to connecting,
to easily reconnect to a server after being kicked
(may have weird side effects)
(this probably only works for 0.3.7-R4)

installation
============

get an asi loader (install CLEO, it comes with one),
and put the asi file in the game root
